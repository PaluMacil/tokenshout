/**
 * Sends the selected action a client selected.
 * Direction: Client To Server
 * Why is both ID and Key given? This is to aid in origination authenticity.
 *   In an environment where the IP address of the clients can not be used to
 *   identify them (think multiple clients behind a router with one public IP)
 *   or are otherwise unreliable, the pair of ID and KEY can be used to increase
 *   trust that the client is who they say they are. If SSL is used this becomes
 *   a moot point.
 *
 * Example: 
 * Server's internal state has player 4 at (0,0)
 * Client decides on action and sends update
 *   Move to (1,0)
 * Server gets packet, identifies player 4, sees action is move and
 * sees new position of (1,0). Validates that player can move to (1,0)
 * and if valid makes the move.
